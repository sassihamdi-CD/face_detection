## General info
A Face Recognition Code in Python can detect faces of people in an images, faces contains a list of coordinates for the rectangular regions where faces were found.

We use these coordinates to draw the rectangles in our image. And also the Face Detection Using Python Project can detect also real time faces in a camera on your laptop or pc.

Similarly, the Face Detection In Python Using Opencv can detect faces in videos. As you know videos are basically made up of frames, which are still images. So we perform the face detection for each frame in a video.

The only difference here is that we use an infinite loop to loop through each frame in the video. We use cap.read() to read each frame.
The first value returned is a flag that indicates if the frame was read correctly or not. We donâ€™t need it. The second value returned is the still frame on which we will be performing the detection.
